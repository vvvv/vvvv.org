You're looking at an [online browser for VL packs]({{< relref "_index.md" >}}).

**Packs**: VL's node library is structured into individual packs. Not all of them are shipping with vvvv, but they can quickly be <a href="https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/reference/hde/managing-nugets.html#managing-nugets" target="_blank">installed as needed</a>. Most of them are open-source and many of them are provided and maintained by your fellow vvvv users. For creating your own packs, see: <a href="https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/reference/extending/publishing.html" target="_blank">Publishing NuGets</a>.

**Extensions**: a special type of packs that extend the vvvv editor rather than the node library. For creating your own extension, see: <a href="https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/reference/extending/editor-extensions.html" target="_blank">Editor Extensions</a>.

Side note: Packs are distributed via the .NET NuGet infrastructure and vvvv can also ingest almost any NuGet found on <a href="https://www.nuget.org/" target="_blank">nuget.org</a>.

The browser's index updates once every 4 hours.
