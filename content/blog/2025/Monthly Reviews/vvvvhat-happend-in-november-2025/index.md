Holy patch,

time flies! So here are a couple of things you may have missed in November:

- You can rewatch the [31st worldwide vvvv meetup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96h-UvwgSvA)
- At that meetup we demonstrated how [your vvvv apps can now host plugins](https://vvvv.org/blog/2025/introducing-plugins-for-your-vvvv-apps/) 
- We've released [Support for OptiTrack](https://vvvv.org/blog/2025/introducing-support-for-optitrack/), high-end marker, rigid-body and skeleton tracking
- We've released support for [Avateering with Orbbec Femto](https://vvvv.org/blog/2025/update-avateering-support-for-orbbec-femto-cameras/) and [also for Kinect2](https://vvvv.org/blog/2025/update-avateering-support-for-kinect2-cameras/) cameras
- We had a great time at the [openDome Meetup](https://thenodeinstitute.org/event/opendome-meetup-ii-at-b-dome/)

...aaand we've picked up work on the PackageManager again and it is going to be amazing!
