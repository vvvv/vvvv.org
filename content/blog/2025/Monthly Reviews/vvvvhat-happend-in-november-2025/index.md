[Action Unit__](https://wtischbein.de/action-unit/) by [Wilhelm Tischbein](https://wtischbein.de/about/)
Like the ancient astrologers, today's AI systems search for patterns to decode humans. Their firmament is the human face. Every emotion is broken down into small fragments: so-called “Action Units” - a machine-readable alphabet of facial expressions. This installation confronts you with the seemingly unquestionable authority of the algorithm and makes you the subject of this modern phrenology. The system measures your differences from the norm. However, this judgment is not a measure of truth, but an echo from a data set - a comparison of your face with thousands of others.
