So!

The big news: Tell all your Apple friends they can finally run vvvv including VL.Stride for 3d rendering on their Silicon! It's not native, you have to run a virtual Windows (bummer, yes), but once you're over that... performance is great and sky is the limit, see: [vvvv on Arm for Windows and Mac, second phase](https://vvvv.org/blog/2025/update-vvvv-on-arm-for-windows-and-mac-phase-2/2/).

Less big but still sweet: [VL.Devices.ZED now supports avateering](https://vvvv.org/blog/2025/update-avateering-support-for-stereolabs-zed-cameras/).

What's cooking? 
- We're about to launch maps for [Businesses](https://vvvv.org/business/) and [Educational Institutions](https://vvvv.org/edu/)
- We're working on more options for Avateering (Kinect, Femto, ...)
- We're working on a way to create plugins for your apps...
- We're fixing bugs as they come in
- And actually many more little and huge things...

Oh and if you haven't already, please consider supporting the [Stride Shader System Rewrite](https://vvvv.org/blog/2025/call-for-support-stride-shader-system-rewrite/)!

And here two dates to save: 
- November 20: [vvvv worldwide meetup 31st edition](https://vvvv.org/blog/2025/31.-vvvv-worldwide-meetup/)
- November 26: [openDome Meetup II at b-dome](https://thenodeinstitute.org/event/opendome-meetup-ii-at-b-dome/)
