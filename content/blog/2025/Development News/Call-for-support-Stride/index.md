Dear shaderers!

Here is a big one: As ya'll know, vvvv's 3d rendering engine is sitting on top of the opensource [Stride3d engine](https://www.stride3d.net/).

What you probably don't know, is what's currently going on over there: 

ðŸ’¥ **[Shader System Rewrite](https://opencollective.com/stride3d/projects/shader-system-rewrite)** ðŸ’¥

And why is this so big then? Well, the biggest thing really is that this is not just a plan anymore, but [development is actively ongoing](https://github.com/stride3d/SDSL) since a while already. It was started by [Youness Kafia](https://github.com/ykafia) who has recently been joined by [xen2](http://github.com/xen2) who used to be the main developer of Stride for many years, before it went opensource. So this is serious business. 

In more practical terms, here is what this means for vvvv, once completed:

ðŸ’¥ Faster shader compilation  
ðŸ’¥ Less memory footprint  
ðŸ’¥ Basis for implementing modern shader stages (pending a switch to DX12)

When can we expect results? To clarify: This is a huge effort and it will most likely take longer than anticipated, to be finally really benefitial for vvvv. But initial estimates we heard was 6 months. So let's say mid next year we should hopefully get an update to see where this is at.

Now here is our ask: If you're working with vvvv, Stride or [Fuse](https://www.thefuselab.io/), you'll benefit from these developments one day. So please, if you can **[add your support to the Stride OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/stride3d/projects/shader-system-rewrite/donate)**. Yes this costs money, but the real value to the developers will be to see your interest in this happening. So don't worry too much about the how-much, the gesture alone is already quite worthy.

Thanks for your consideration!
