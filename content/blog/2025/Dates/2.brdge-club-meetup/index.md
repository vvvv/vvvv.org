Hello!

As you may or may not know we had our [first BRDGE Club Meetup](https://vvvv.org/blog/2025/brdge-club-meetup/) last September, and are now happy to invite you to our second edition titled: **"How do you data?"**.

In this session we intend to go deeper into the topic of **data management**, something most projects need in one way or another.

We will be diving into both **content data** as well as **visitor data** management, showcasing our two tools designed for these purposes:

- **BRDGE Content**: a multi-tenant multi-language museum/event oriented CMS
- **BRDGE Journey**: a REST API for managing visitor journeys and activities

We will cover the core concepts and ideas used by these tools with hands on demonstrations as well as real life stories and use cases.

Hopefully there's something of interest for everybody and the tools might just spark your attention.

## Agenda Highlights

- Content Data management with **BRDGE Content**
- Visitor Data management with **BRDGE Journey**
- Experiences, workflows, lessons learned
- Open discussion

Join us to learn, exchange, and explore how we can **bridge code, design, and scalable experiences together**.

And if you want to be part of the ongoing conversation, consider dropping by our [Element chat BRDGE space](https://matrix.to/#/#brdge:matrix.org).
