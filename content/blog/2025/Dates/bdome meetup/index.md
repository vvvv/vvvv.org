Full dome anyone?

![B-Dome](Bdome.jpg)

Join us at [openDome Meetup II at b-dome](https://thenodeinstitute.org/event/opendome-meetup-ii-at-b-dome/) organized by the fine people over at [The NODE Institute](https://thenodeinstitute.org).

**The gist**: You come and bring your vvvv patches and we can watch your creations together on the big screen. 

**The treat**: Aside of the "Submission Options" (NDI streaming, video playback) as  [detailed here](https://thenodeinstitute.org/event/opendome-meetup-ii-at-b-dome/), with vvvv you have the exclusive alternative of running your patches directly on the playout server as we have projector warping and blending realized in vvvv natively. This means best quality and lowest latency. 

## Preparing content
Essentially you'll have to produce a square texture. Two options:
- Any flat texture will just be viewable like a wallpaper
- If you you have 3d content, use the [Domemaster](https://forum.vvvv.org/t/vl-domemaster/20660) setup to create a suitable texture for the 180° dome. Problems with that? We'll figure it out together on site.
  
Either way your texture will go through another pass (we've prepared) that does the warping and blending and goes out fullscreen to the 6 projectors at a total resolution of 5760x2400.
