## [UI Frameworks & Patterns in vvvv](https://thenodeinstitute.org/courses/ui-frameworks-patterns-in-vvvv/)  
February 26 + 27, 2026 — 18:00–21:00 CET  
Live and Online · Recordings included

Designing user interfaces in vvvv has become increasingly flexible over the past years. With options ranging from ImGui and Avalonia to Rive or browser‑based UIs via CEF, and rendering engines like Skia and Stride, the ecosystem now offers a wide range of approaches — but also a fair amount of complexity when choosing the right one.

To help developers navigate this landscape, we’re hosting a new workshop:

In this two‑session class, Nils Weger ([Phlegma](https://vvvv.org/people/phlegma)) provides a structured overview of the current UI options in vvvv and explains how they differ in workflow, performance, and architectural implications. 

## The workshop covers comparing UI frameworks: 
- [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) shipped with VVVV in [VL.StandardLibs](https://github.com/vvvv/VL.StandardLibs)
- [Avalonia](https://avaloniaui.net/) with [VL.Avalonia](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VL.Avalonia)
- [Rive](https://rive.app) with [VL.Rive](https://github.com/vvvv/VL.Rive)
- Web-Interfaces via [VL.CEF](https://github.com/vvvv/VL.CEF)

## The lessons further cover:
- Understanding rendering backends: Skia vs Stride
- Choosing the right UI stack for tools, installations, and interactive systems
- Architecture patterns: MVVM and Model–View–Runtime
- Managing application logic with data channels and state machines
- Interaction models for mouse, keyboard, touch, hit‑testing and unified pointers

The goal is to give participants a clear mental model of how UI development in vvvv works today, and how to structure applications in a way that remains maintainable as projects grow.


## About the instructor

Nils Weger ([Phlegma](https://vvvv.org/people/phlegma))  is a Media System Designer with two decades of experience building interactive tools and interfaces. His work ranges from robotic sculpting systems to control panels and multi‑touch installations. He has collaborated with Studio Brüll, Meso, Nsynk and others, and has been teaching vvvv since the early days.
