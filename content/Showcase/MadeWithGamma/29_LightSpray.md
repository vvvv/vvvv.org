Like a quiet forest, any movement disrupts the intimate stillness, generating echoes that only time can fade. Bespoke software registers motion and noise, pausing the generative process until stillness is restored, allowing it to emerge again from the void. The audience, oscillating between observing and being observed, is invited to reflect on witnessing as a delicate form of participation.
