Sanctuary of the Unseen Forest is a large-scale video installation that creates a moment of awe, felt, when we embrace the presence of a majestic being, a giant Ceiba pentandra from the Colombian Amazon. The artwork becomes a sanctuary, a place to reflect and contemplate our place within the wider systems of nature.
